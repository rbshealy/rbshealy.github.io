Hi. I’m **Ray Shealy**, a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, expected to graduate in December of 2025 (4.0 GPA as of August 2025).  

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a mix of technical projects that range from backend automation to frontend tools. Most recently, during a software engineering internship at USAA, I built a Chrome extension that connected GitLab data directly into ServiceNow workflows. Before that, I worked at Akoustis, Inc., where I supported logistics and later developed software solutions to streamline operations.  

In the spring of 2025 at UNC, I had the opportunity to conduct mentored research alongside Dr. Henry Fuchs (Federico Gil Distinguished Professor), where we explored power-saving solutions for next-generation AR/VR glasses. While my results weren't formally published, the report is available on my [publications](/_publications/) page.  

I’m interested in the overlap between AI, Graphics, ComputerVision, and AR/VR, that of which I've explored throughout my undergraduate studies. I’m also especially grateful for the guidance of my mentor, Akshay Paruchuri, whose support has shaped much of my growth during my time at UNC.
