I spent most of the semester during fall 2024 building a 2D graphics engine similar to <a href='https://skia.org/'>Skia</a> from the ground up. Above are some capabilities of the engine. It is able to quickly and accurately raster, interpolate, and shade complex shapes with image and color maps. This was my first full experience exploring different computer graphics algorithms and methods. The course 2D Computer Graphics (Comp 475) was taught by
<a href='https://cs.unc.edu/person/mike-reed/'>Mike Reed</a> (Adjunct Professor).
